# Pandas-Homework
The attached jupyter notbook is a tool that analyzes and visualizes the major metrics of volatility, returns, risk and Sharpe Ratios across portfolios and determines which portfolio outperformed the others. I have used the historical daily returns of several portfolios: some from the firm's algorithmic portfolios, some that represent the portfolios of famous "whale" investors like Warren Buffett, and some from the big hedge and mutual funds. 

I have also created  a custom portfolio of stocks and compared them to the performance of the other portfolios, as well as the larger market (S&P 500 Index).
